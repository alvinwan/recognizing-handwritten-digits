# Introduction to PyTorch: Build a Neural Network to Recognize Handwritten Digits (MNIST)

Training a neural network to recognize handwritten digits (MNIST), using PyTorch. This repository includes all source code for the tutorial on DigitalOcean with the same title, including:

- MNIST training and evaluation code using a simple, custom neural network
- MNIST training and evaluation code using torchvision's ResNet18 architecture
- source code for associated Google Colab notebooks: [Custom Arch notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1lolktSYm6DwTRTcoaxREU35Uy1nbWgtT?usp=sharing) + [ResNet18 notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1mSU49NmA9hUkXKU3xqfpjsxkxihjw9PU?usp=sharing)
